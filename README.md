# Gods' Retribution

## Special Blocks and Items

### Waste Processor
Any item given to this machine will be processed without mercy and made into a waste. You can then compact 9 wastes to
make a waste block.
However, some items and blocks are considered as waste, and thus cannot be processed by the machine. Such are wastes,
waste blocks, ashes, ashes blocks, flints and flint blocks.

The waste processor needs kinetic energy in order to work.

### Waste and Waste Block
Just rubbish. No usage, except from being burnt into ashes. Which has no usages. Just here to be thrown out somewhere in
the wild.

### Glue
Made out of bones, rabbit hides, fishes or slime balls, glue will be used in a wide range of recipes.

### Plastic
Made out of crude oil.
